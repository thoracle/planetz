# PlanetZ Playwright Testing Rules

# Always use the MCP Playwright server for testing Star Charts functionality
# The server provides tools to run automated Playwright tests without manual setup

# When testing Star Charts tooltips:
# - Use run_star_charts_tooltip_tests tool for tooltip validation
# - Use run_star_charts_hitbox_tests tool for hitbox validation
# - Use run_full_test_suite tool for comprehensive testing

# Before running tests, ensure the test environment is set up using setup_test_environment tool

# Test results will be provided in real-time through the MCP server output
