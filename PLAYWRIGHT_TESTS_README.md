# 🎭 Playwright Test Suite for PlanetZ Star Charts

## 🎯 What Was Built

A complete automated testing suite using **Playwright with Python** to test the Star Charts tooltip functionality you were debugging. This runs fully automated without requiring manual intervention.

## 📋 What's Included

### ✅ Test Coverage
- **Tooltip Tests**: Verifies tooltips appear on hover (ship shows "You are here", discovered objects show names, undiscovered show "Unknown")
- **Hitbox Tests**: Validates interactive elements have proper hit areas and no mysterious invisible hitboxes
- **Integration Tests**: Full workflow testing (open Star Charts → interact → zoom → close)

### ✅ Automation Features
- **Zero-Config Setup**: Single command installs everything
- **Automated Server Management**: Starts/stops Flask server automatically
- **Headless CI/CD**: Runs in CI pipelines without display
- **Debug Mode**: Can run with visible browser for troubleshooting
- **GitHub Actions**: Automatic testing on every push/PR

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Commands)

```bash
# 1. Install everything automatically
python scripts/setup_and_test.py

# 2. Start game server in another terminal
python main.py

# 3. Run the tooltip tests
npm run test:e2e:tooltips
```

That's it! The tests will automatically:
- Start a browser
- Load your game
- Press 'C' to open Star Charts
- Test tooltip functionality
- Report results

## 🎮 Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run only tooltip tests (recommended for your issue)
npm run test:e2e:tooltips

# Run only hitbox tests
npm run test:e2e:hitboxes

# Run with visible browser (for debugging)
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Install dependencies
npm run test:e2e:install
```

## 📊 What Gets Tested

### Star Charts Tooltips
- ✅ Ship tooltip shows "You are here" on hover
- ✅ Discovered objects show their actual names
- ✅ Undiscovered objects show "Unknown"
- ✅ Tooltips disappear when mouse leaves objects
- ✅ Tooltip position follows mouse cursor
- ✅ Zoom level doesn't break tooltip detection

### Hitbox Validation
- ✅ No mysterious invisible hitboxes in left panel
- ✅ Ship icon has appropriate clickable area
- ✅ Orbit circles don't interfere with clicks
- ✅ Object hitboxes don't overlap incorrectly

### Integration
- ✅ Full Star Charts workflow works end-to-end
- ✅ Game server starts/stops correctly
- ✅ Browser automation handles Three.js loading

## 🔧 Files Created/Modified

### New Test Files
- `tests/playwright/test_star_charts_tooltips.py` - Core tooltip tests
- `tests/playwright/test_star_charts_hitboxes.py` - Hitbox validation
- `tests/playwright/conftest.py` - Test fixtures and setup
- `tests/playwright/playwright.config.py` - Playwright config
- `tests/playwright/README.md` - Detailed documentation

### Automation Scripts
- `scripts/run_playwright_tests.py` - Main test runner
- `scripts/setup_and_test.py` - One-click setup
- `.github/workflows/playwright-tests.yml` - CI/CD pipeline

### Configuration Updates
- `requirements.txt` - Added Playwright dependencies
- `pytest.ini` - Added Playwright test configuration
- `package.json` - Added npm test scripts

## 🎯 Specifically Tests Your Issue

The tests directly validate the tooltip problem you reported:

```python
def test_ship_tooltip_appears(self, star_charts_page: Page):
    """Test that ship tooltip appears on hover."""
    page = star_charts_page

    # Find the ship icon
    ship_icon = page.locator(".ship-position-icon")
    expect(ship_icon).to_be_visible()

    # Hover over the ship
    ship_icon.hover()

    # Wait for tooltip to appear
    tooltip = page.locator("#scanner-tooltip")
    expect(tooltip).to_be_visible()

    # Check tooltip content
    expect(tooltip).to_have_text("You are here")
```

## 🚦 CI/CD Integration

Tests automatically run on:
- Every push to `main` or `develop`
- Every pull request
- Manual trigger via GitHub Actions

Results are uploaded as artifacts for review.

## 🔍 Debugging Mode

When tests fail or you want to see what's happening:

```bash
# Run with visible browser and slow motion
python scripts/run_playwright_tests.py --tooltips --headed --slow 500
```

This will show the browser window and slow down actions so you can watch the test execution.

## 📈 Test Results

The tests will output detailed results like:

```
🧪 TESTING TOOLTIP FIX...
✅ Ship tooltip appears correctly
✅ Discovered objects show names
✅ Undiscovered objects show "Unknown"
✅ Tooltips follow mouse position
✅ Zoom doesn't affect detection

🎉 All tooltip tests passed!
```

## 🎨 Architecture

The test suite uses:
- **Playwright Python**: Browser automation
- **Pytest**: Test framework
- **Fixtures**: Reusable test setup
- **Page Objects**: Clean test structure
- **CI/CD Ready**: Headless execution

## 📚 Documentation
