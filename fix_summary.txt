DAMAGE CONTROL SYSTEM FIX SUMMARY
==================================

üêõ THE PROBLEM:
- The debugDamageRandomSystems() method was calling system.damage(damageAmount)
- But the System class only has a takeDamage(damage) method, not damage()
- This meant the damage was never actually being applied to the systems
- The damage control display was working correctly, but there was no damage to display

üîß THE FIX:
- Changed system.damage(damageAmount) to system.takeDamage(damageAmount)
- Fixed the damage calculation to use absolute damage values (damageAmount * system.maxHealth)
- Updated the console script to provide better debugging information

‚úÖ NOW THE DAMAGE SYSTEM SHOULD WORK CORRECTLY:
1. Press D to open damage control view
2. Use Ctrl+Shift+V to damage random systems
3. You should now see the damage reflected in the interface
4. Use the updated console script for detailed debugging

The damage will now properly show up in the damage control interface with:
- Red/orange/yellow health percentages based on damage level
- Proper system status indicators
- Working repair priority sliders

üéÆ TESTING:
- Load the game and press D to open damage control
- Run the console script (damage-random-systems-console.js)
- Use damageRandomSystems() to apply damage
- You should now see systems with less than 100% health
- Use repairAll() to fix everything back to 100%
