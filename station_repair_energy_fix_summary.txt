STATION REPAIR INTERFACE ENERGY FIX SUMMARY
===========================================

üêõ THE PROBLEM:
- The StationRepairInterface.js was trying to access ship energy using the wrong structure
- It was using: this.ship.energy.current and this.ship.energy.max
- But the Ship class actually uses: this.ship.currentEnergy and this.ship.maxEnergy
- This caused a TypeError when trying to repair systems at a station

üîß THE FIX:
- Fixed the rechargeEnergy() method in StationRepairInterface.js
- Changed: this.ship.energy.current = this.ship.energy.max;
- To: this.ship.currentEnergy = this.ship.maxEnergy;

‚úÖ WHAT THIS FIXES:
- Station repair interface now works correctly
- Energy is properly recharged to full when repairing systems
- No more TypeError when clicking repair buttons at stations
- Both hull repair and system repair functions now work properly

üéÆ HOW TO TEST:
1. Dock at a station (press SPACE when near a station)
2. Click "Repair Ship" to open the repair interface
3. Select systems to repair and click repair buttons
4. Energy should now be recharged properly without errors

The repair interface should now function correctly without the energy access error.
