# 🎮 PLANETZ GAME - Bluehost Chunk Error Fix

## 🚨 Problem Solved!

**Issue**: Game loads but shows chunk errors like:
- `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404`
- `Chunk (x, y, z) - Worker error: [object Event] - Marking chunk as failed after 3 attempts`

**Root Cause**: Web Worker path mismatch between local development and Bluehost deployment.
- **Local**: `/js/workers/meshGenerator.worker.js` ✗
- **Bluehost**: `static/js/workers/meshGenerator.worker.js` ✅

## 📦 FIXED Deployment Package Ready!

**File**: `planetz-bluehost-deployment-FIXED.zip` (1.4MB)
**File**: `planetz-bluehost-deployment-FIXED.tar.gz` (1.4MB)

Contains the corrected worker path that matches Bluehost's file structure.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **Worker Path Correction**
```javascript
// BEFORE (causing 404 errors):
this.worker = new Worker('/js/workers/meshGenerator.worker.js');

// AFTER (working on Bluehost):
this.worker = new Worker('static/js/workers/meshGenerator.worker.js');
```

### **File Changed**
- `frontend/static/js/chunk.js` - Line 130

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### **Step 1: Remove Old Files**
1. Log into Bluehost cPanel
2. Open File Manager
3. Delete the existing game folder from `public_html/`

### **Step 2: Upload Fixed Version**
1. Upload `planetz-bluehost-deployment-FIXED.zip`
2. Extract to your desired location:
   - **Main domain**: `/public_html/` (game at yourdomain.com)
   - **Subdomain**: `/public_html/game/` (game at yourdomain.com/game)
   - **Separate folder**: Create new folder and extract there

### **Step 3: Test The Fix**
1. Visit your game URL
2. Check browser console (F12) - should see NO 404 errors
3. Wait for terrain to generate - chunks should load without errors
4. Navigate around - world should generate smoothly

## ✅ Expected Results After Fix

### **Before Fix (Broken)**
```
❌ Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404
❌ Chunk (2, 2, 0) - Worker error: [object Event] - Marking chunk as failed
❌ Chunk (-3, 1, 1) - Worker error: [object Event] - Marking chunk as failed
❌ World generation failing, missing terrain
```

### **After Fix (Working)**
```
✅ Workers loading successfully
✅ Chunks generating without errors  
✅ Smooth terrain generation
✅ No 404 errors in console
✅ Full 3D world experience
```

## 🔍 Additional Troubleshooting

### **If Still Getting Errors:**

1. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)
   - Clear all site data

2. **Check File Permissions**
   - All files should be 644
   - All folders should be 755

3. **Verify File Structure**
   ```
   planetz/
   ├── frontend/
   │   ├── index.html
   │   └── static/
   │       └── js/
   │           └── workers/
   │               └── meshGenerator.worker.js ✅
   ```

4. **Check .htaccess Settings**
   - Ensure `.js` files are served with correct MIME type
   - Should be in the fixed package already

### **MIME Type Fix (if needed)**
Add to `.htaccess`:
```apache
# Ensure JavaScript files are served correctly
AddType application/javascript .js
AddType text/javascript .js

# Allow Web Workers
<Files "*.worker.js">
    Header set Content-Type "application/javascript"
</Files>
```

## 🎯 Why This Happened

### **Development vs Production Paths**
- **Local development**: Files served from root `/`
- **Bluehost hosting**: Files served from `static/` subdirectory
- **Web Workers**: Require absolute paths to load correctly

### **Solution Approach**
- Changed from absolute path `/js/...` 
- To relative path `static/js/...`
- Matches the actual file structure on Bluehost

## 🔄 Future Deployments

The source files have also been updated, so future deployments will automatically have the correct paths. No need to manually fix this again!

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

If you're still seeing chunk errors after deploying the FIXED version:

1. Check browser console for exact error messages
2. Verify the `meshGenerator.worker.js` file exists at the correct path
3. Test on different browsers
4. Check Bluehost error logs in cPanel
