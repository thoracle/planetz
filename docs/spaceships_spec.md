## Design Specification: NFT Card Collection Spaceship System âœ… IMPLEMENTED

### Overview
The spaceship feature allows players to pilot one of five distinct ship types, with upgradable and damageable systems powered by an NFT card collection system inspired by Clash Royale. Players collect cards through loot drops and missions, stack identical cards to upgrade systems, and customize their ships through a universal slot system. The game emphasizes strategic collection, deck building, and tactical combat with meaningful damage consequences.

**âœ… STATUS**: Fully implemented with drag-and-drop interface, multi-ship ownership, station integration, and WeaponSyncManager for unified weapon initialization.

### NFT Card Collection System âœ… IMPLEMENTED

#### Pseudo-NFT Implementation (MVP)
For initial development, we implement a pseudo-NFT system that mimics real NFT behavior:
- âœ… Each card has a unique token ID and metadata
- âœ… Cards are never consumed or destroyed during upgrades
- âœ… Cards accumulate in a crypto wallet simulation
- ðŸ”„ Future integration with real NFT marketplaces (OpenSea, etc.)

  - Level 2â†’3: 6x cards  
  - Level 3â†’4: 12x cards
  - Level 4â†’5: 24x cards
- âœ… **Card Preservation**: Cards are never consumed, only accumulated
