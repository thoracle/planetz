## Design Specification: Upgradable and Damageable Spaceship Feature for Space Shooter Game

### Overview
The spaceship feature allows players to pilot one of five distinct ship types, inspired by Elite, Privateer, and Freelancer, with upgradable and damageable systems. Players fly one ship at a time, upgrading systems to enhance performance and tailoring it to their playstyle. Nine critical systems can take damage, impacting gameplay, with limited in-space repair capabilities and full repairs available at space stations. A damage report screen provides real-time system status. The system emphasizes strategic trade-offs in upgrades, repairs, and ship roles, balancing speed, firepower, armor, and cargo capacity.

At 100% damage, missile tubes are inoperable.

Gameplay Impact: Reduces burst damage, significant for Heavy Fighters.

Main Weapons
Function: Primary weapon system (lasers, plasma cannons, etc.).

Damage Effect:
Reduces damage output and firing rate (e.g., 50% damage = 50% reduced damage).

At 100% damage, main weapons are disabled.

Gameplay Impact: Cripples combat capability, critical for Fighters.

Deflector Shields
Function: Absorbs incoming damage before hull/armor.

Damage Effect:
Reduces shield capacity and recharge rate (e.g., 50% damage = 50% shield HP).

At 100% damage, shields are offline.

Gameplay Impact: Increases vulnerability, especially for Heavy Fighters and Freighters.

Damage Mechanics
Damage Sources: Systems take damage from enemy weapons, collisions, environmental hazards (e.g., radiation, asteroids), or critical hits (5% chance per hull hit, dealing 10-20% damage to a specific system).

Damage Application:
Damage is distributed randomly across systems when hull is hit after shields are depleted.

Environmental hazards may target specific systems (e.g., radiation damages Warp Drive, Scanner).

Status Tiers:
0-25% Damage: Minor impairment, slight performance reduction.

26-50% Damage: Moderate impairment, noticeable performance drop.

51-75% Damage: Severe impairment, significant functionality loss.

76-100% Damage: Critical impairment, system barely functional or disabled.

Feedback: Visual cues (e.g., sparking consoles) and audio (e.g., warning alarms) indicate damage.

Repair Mechanics
In-Space Repairs:
Method: Players use “Repair Kits” (consumable items) to restore 10-25% system health (based on kit quality: Basic, Advanced, Elite).

Limitations:
Players carry 3-5 kits, depending on cargo capacity.

Repairs take 30-60 seconds per kit, cannot be done in combat, and are limited to one system at a time.

Acquisition: Kits are purchased, looted, or crafted.

Trade-offs: Kits compete with cargo space, forcing prioritization.

Station Repairs:
Method: Docking at a station allows full repairs for credits.

Mechanics:
Costs scale with damage severity and ship class (e.g., Heavy Freighter repairs are pricier).

Full repairs take 1-5 minutes, with instant repair options for extra credits.

Some stations require faction reputation or upgrades for repair access.

Strategic Considerations: Players must balance using limited kits in space or docking for full repairs, prioritizing systems based on mission needs.

Damage Report Screen
Purpose: Displays real-time status of all damageable systems and manages repairs.

Layout:
System List: Lists all nine systems with:
Name, icon, and health bar (0-100%, color-coded: green = 0-25%, yellow = 26-50%, orange = 51-75%, red = 76-100%).

Performance penalty (e.g., “Impulse Engines: 60% damage, -60% speed”).

Repair Interface:
Button to apply Repair Kits (shows available kits and quality).

Timer/progress bar for in-space repairs.

Station repair cost and time estimates when docked.

Alerts: Flashing indicators or pop-ups for critical damage (76-100%).

Visuals: 3D ship schematic highlighting damaged systems; tooltips explain functions and effects.

Access: Via ship management menu or hotkey.

Feedback: Audio cues (e.g., “Warning: Shields Critical”) and visual effects (e.g., flickering HUD).

Upgrade and Damage Integration
Upgrades Impact Damage:
Higher-tier systems (e.g., Elite Shields) have more health (e.g., +20% base durability) but are costlier to repair.

Damaged systems reduce upgrade effectiveness (e.g., 50% damaged Elite Thrusters perform like Basic Thrusters).

Power Grid: Damaged systems may draw less power, freeing it for other systems, but reduce overall performance.

Repair Costs: Upgraded systems cost more to repair (e.g., Elite Shields = 2x Basic Shield repair cost).

Upgrade Mechanics
Acquisition: Upgrades are purchased, looted, or crafted using resources (e.g., alloys, circuits).

Installation: Requires shipyard, takes 1-5 minutes or credits to fast-track.

Compatibility: Ships have power grid and slot limits; upgrades consume both, forcing balance.

Progression: Higher-tier upgrades are locked behind player level, faction reputation, or missions.

Customization: Players can save loadouts for quick swapping.

Balance Considerations
Trade-offs: Upgrades enhance one system at the cost of others (e.g., maxed engines reduce weapon output). Damage forces further prioritization.

Economy: Upgrade and repair costs scale with tier and ship class.

Gameplay Impact: Upgrades and repairs enhance mission viability but preserve ship role identity (e.g., Scouts can’t become tanks).

Damage Balance: Systems like Warp Drive or Shields are critical, making their damage high-stakes but not game-ending.

User Interface
Ship Management Screen:
Displays stats, equipped upgrades, slots, power grid, and damage status.

Drag-and-drop for upgrades; repair options for damaged systems.

Visual indicators for trade-offs (e.g., red bar for overloaded power grid) and damage.

Upgrade Market:
Lists upgrades with stats, costs, and compatibility; filters by ship class, system, or tier.

Damage Report Screen: As described above, integrated into the ship management menu.

Feedback: Tooltips explain trade-offs, damage effects, and repair options.

Technical Notes
Data Structure: Ship stat block (JSON/XML) includes base stats, slots, power grid, and system health. Upgrades and damage modify values dynamically.

Balancing: Use formulas (e.g., Speed = BaseSpeed × (1 + EngineBonus - ArmorPenalty - DamagePenalty)).

Storage: Save ship configurations, upgrades, and damage status in the game database.

Testing: Ensure upgrades and damage don’t break ship roles; test repair balance for accessibility.

Future Considerations
Modularity: Add cosmetic upgrades or faction-specific parts.

Dynamic Events: Rare upgrades or repair kits via limited-time missions.

Cross-Ship Progression: Allow upgrade transfers between ships with conversion costs.

Environmental Hazards: Expand hazard types (e.g., EMPs targeting Targeting Computer) for variety.

This specification integrates upgradable and damageable systems, creating a dynamic, strategic experience that aligns with the spirit of Elite, Privateer, and Freelancer.
