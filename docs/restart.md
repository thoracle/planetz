## 🔧 Critical Technical Context

### **Mission System Architecture**
- **States**: UNKNOWN → MENTIONED → ACCEPTED → ACHIEVED → COMPLETED
- **Dual Delivery Types**: `auto_delivery` (on docking) vs `market_sale` (on selling)
- **Event-Driven**: Frontend triggers backend via `MissionEventService`
- **Files**: JSON-based storage in `missions/` directories

### **Physics & Combat**
- **Ammo.js physics**: Build with native collision detection
- **Missile targeting**: Velocity-compensated projectiles
- **Collision system**: Distance-based delays reduce tunneling at high speeds
- **Hitscan lasers**: Tolerance-based hitscan with weapon-specific ranges; ongoing tuning for crosshair alignment and ship resolution

### **Faction Color System**
```javascript
// Universal color coding across all UI elements
enemy: '#ff3333'     // Red for hostile
neutral: '#ffff44'   // Yellow for neutral  
friendly: '#44ff44'  // Green for friendly
unknown: '#44ffff'   // Cyan for unknown
```

### **Key Architectural Decisions**
- **Target Preservation**: Q-key dummy creation maintains current target via identifier matching
- **Unified Credits**: Single `PlayerCredits.js` manages economy across all systems
- **Modular Cards**: Ship systems installed via card-based upgrade system
- **Event-Driven UI**: Real-time updates via direct mission data passing (no stale API calls)

## 🎊 Current Development Status

**IN DEVELOPMENT** ✅ Core systems implemented; active tuning and validation:

- ✅ **Complete Mission System** with cargo delivery, unified economy, station positioning
- ✅ **Cut Scene System Specification** with visual storyboards and implementation guidance  
- ✅ **Advanced Combat** with faction colors and audio feedback (ongoing hitscan alignment improvements)
- ✅ **Enemy AI Framework** with 8 ship types, flocking, and combat behaviors
- ✅ **Faction Universe** with 10 factions, 50+ NPCs, diplomatic complexity
- ✅ **Navigation Systems** with 3D radar, long-range scanner, beacon network
- ✅ **Communication HUD** with animated wireframe avatars and NPC interaction

**Next Steps**: Content creation, advanced gameplay mechanics, multiplayer foundation.
