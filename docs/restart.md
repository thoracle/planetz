# PROJECT CONTEXT: Planetz - 3D Space Combat Game

You're joining the development of **Planetz**, a fully functional 3D web-based space simulation game inspired by Elite, Privateer, and Star Raiders. The game is built with Three.js (frontend), Flask/Python (backend), and features complete ship management, combat, targeting, and exploration systems.

## 📁 Current Project State
- **Branch**: `optimization` (up to date with origin)
- **Latest Commit**: `521abef` - Ammo.js loading path fix and physics improvements
- **Tech Stack**: Three.js, ES6+ modules, Flask/Python backend, HTML5/CSS3, Ammo.js physics
- **Codebase**: 25,000+ lines, 150+ files, fully modular architecture
- **Recent Fixes**: Ammo.js loading paths, physics initialization, target removal precision, TAB cycling duplicates
- **Status**: Fully functional combat game with reliable physics engine and working target systems

## 🔧 Key Files Recently Modified
- `frontend/index.html` - Fixed Ammo.js dynamic loading with consistent static paths
- `frontend/static/index.html` - Updated static file paths and Ammo.js loading
- `frontend/static/js/PhysicsManager.js` - Enhanced physics initialization error handling
- `frontend/static/js/views/TargetComputerManager.js` - Target list management and cycling logic
- `frontend/static/js/app.js` - Physics engine initialization and event listener management
- `frontend/static/js/ship/systems/WeaponSlot.js` - Weapon firing and destruction detection

- `frontend/static/js/views/StarfieldManager.js` - Target removal and cleanup

## 🐛 Recent Bug Fixes (Completed)

### 1. **Ammo.js Loading Path Issue** ⭐ LATEST FIX
- **Problem**: `❌ Failed to load Ammo.js from static/lib/ammo.js` and physics initialization timeouts
- **Root Cause**: Path resolution mismatch between Flask server (port 5001) and direct file serving
- **Solution**: 
  - Replaced conditional port-based paths with consistent `'static/lib/ammo.js'` for all servers
  - Enhanced dynamic loading mechanism with comprehensive error handling
  - Added loading status tracking and fallback mechanisms
- **Files**: `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/static/index.html`, `PhysicsManager.js`
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETELY RESOLVED - Physics engine now initializes reliably
- **Commit**: `521abef`

### 2. **Target removal precision** 
- **Problem**: Ships showing 0% hull but remaining in target list
- **Solution**: Changed destruction detection from `currentHull <= 0` to `currentHull <= 0.001` AND added defensive filtering in target list generation
- **Files**: `WeaponSlot.js`, `EnemyShip.js`, `TargetComputerManager.js`
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETELY RESOLVED - Added hull filtering to all target list generation methods

### 3. **Physics hit detection** 
- **Problem**: "Hit entity does not have a ship with applyDamage method"
- **Solution**: Updated `PhysicsManager` to properly link ship objects to physics entities
- **Files**: `PhysicsManager.js`

### 4. **Subsystem targeting** 
- **Problem**: Sub-targeted damage was spilling to hull and other systems
- **Solution**: Updated `applyDamage` to handle `targetSystem` parameter correctly
- **Files**: `EnemyShip.js`

### 5. **Success audio** 
- **Problem**: Missing audio feedback when destroying subsystems
- **Solution**: Added sound playback logic to `applyDamage` method
- **Files**: `EnemyShip.js`

### 6. **Duplicate TAB cycling** 
- **Problem**: TAB key was processed multiple times due to duplicate event listeners AND duplicate target entries in target list
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate TAB key event listeners in `app.js` AND fixed duplicate target population in `TargetComputerManager.js`
- **Root Cause**: Both `updateTargetListWithPhysics()` and `addNonPhysicsTargets()` were adding the same dummy ships to the target list
- **Files**: `app.js`, `TargetComputerManager.js`, `StarfieldManager.js`
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETELY RESOLVED - TAB now cycles correctly through unique targets without duplicates
