- ✅ **Better Performance** - Direct Three.js operations vs physics engine overhead
- ✅ **Easier Maintenance** - No complex physics engine setup or debugging
- ✅ **Future-Proof** - Direct control over collision and physics behavior

### **Coordinate System & World Units** 📏 **CRITICAL REFERENCE**

**PRIMARY WORLD UNIT: KILOMETERS** 🌍

The Planetz game engine uses **kilometers (km)** as the fundamental world unit across all systems:

#### **Core Coordinate System**:
- ✅ **World Scale**: 1 game unit = 1 kilometer
- ✅ **Camera Position**: Measured in kilometers from origin
- ✅ **Object Positions**: All celestial bodies, stations, and ships positioned in km
- ✅ **Distance Calculations**: All proximity, targeting, and collision systems use km
- ✅ **Discovery Range**: 100km discovery radius (no unit conversion needed)

#### **System Consistency**:
- ✅ **Three.js Scene**: Direct km coordinates (no scaling factors)
- ✅ **Physics Calculations**: Native km-based distance and velocity calculations
- ✅ **Weapon Systems**: Range and targeting calculations in km
- ✅ **Navigation**: All navigation beacons and waypoints positioned in km
- ✅ **Spatial Partitioning**: Grid cells sized in km for optimal performance

#### **Important Notes**:
- ❌ **NOT Meters**: Avoid meter-based calculations or conversions
- ❌ **NOT Astronomical Units (AU)**: No AU conversions in core systems
- ✅ **Unified Coordinates**: ALL objects use standard 3D Cartesian coordinates `[x, y, z]` in km
- ✅ **No Coordinate Exceptions**: Beacons, stations, ships - everything uses the same `[x, y, z]` format
- ✅ **Simplified System**: No polar coordinate conversion needed - direct km positioning
- ✅ **Discovery System**: 100km range works directly with km-based positions

#### **Why Kilometers**:
- **Human-Scale Comprehension**: Distances like "175km to beacon" are intuitive
- **Performance Optimization**: No constant unit conversions during gameplay
- **Precision Balance**: Sufficient precision for space combat without floating-point issues
- **Consistency**: Single unit system eliminates coordinate system bugs

**🚨 CRITICAL**: When adding new systems, always use kilometers as the base unit. Any unit conversions should be clearly documented and isolated to specific display/UI functions only.

### **Object ID Naming Convention** 🏷️ **CRITICAL REFERENCE**

**STANDARD FORMAT: UPPERCASE A0_ PREFIX** 🔤

The Planetz game engine uses **uppercase `A0_` prefixes** for all object IDs across all systems:

#### **Correct ID Format**:
- ✅ **Navigation Beacons**: `A0_navigation_beacon_1`, `A0_navigation_beacon_2`, etc.
- ✅ **Stations**: `A0_hermes_refinery`, `A0_terra_station`, etc.
- ✅ **Planets**: `A0_mars`, `A0_europa`, etc.
- ✅ **All Objects**: Consistent `A0_` prefix in uppercase

#### **Important Notes**:
- ❌ **NOT lowercase**: Avoid `a0_navigation_beacon_1` - use `A0_navigation_beacon_1`
- ❌ **NOT mixed case**: Avoid `a0_` or `Ao_` - always use `A0_`
- ✅ **Case Normalization**: Code includes `.replace(/^a0_/i, 'A0_')` for legacy compatibility
- ✅ **Consistent Lookups**: All ID comparisons normalize to uppercase `A0_` format

#### **Why Uppercase A0_**:
- **Database Consistency**: Matches backend object ID format
- **Targeting System**: Ensures reliable object lookup and targeting
- **Discovery System**: Prevents case-sensitive ID mismatch bugs
- **Integration**: Seamless Star Charts ↔ Target Computer communication

**🚨 CRITICAL**: When adding new objects or systems, always use uppercase `A0_` prefix for IDs. Legacy lowercase `a0_` IDs are automatically normalized but should be avoided in new code.

### **Mission System Architecture**
- **States**: UNKNOWN → MENTIONED → ACCEPTED → ACHIEVED → COMPLETED
- **Dual Delivery Types**: `auto_delivery` (on docking) vs `market_sale` (on selling)
- **Event-Driven**: Frontend triggers backend via `MissionEventService`
- **Files**: JSON-based storage in `missions/` directories

### **Cargo Delivery System** (Recently Fixed)
- **Automatic Completion**: Cargo missions complete automatically when docking at destination stations
- **Station Detection**: Robust detection via metadata + name pattern fallback (Station, Base, Outpost, etc.)
- **Name Conversion**: `"Europa Research Station"` → `"europa_research_station"` for backend matching
- **Unified Docking**: Integrated with `SimpleDockingManager.initiateUnifiedDocking()` method
- **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive console output for troubleshooting station detection and cargo events

### **Combat & Collision System**
- **Three.js collision detection**: Native raycasting for hit detection
- **Missile targeting**: Velocity-compensated projectiles with Three.js physics
- **Hitscan weapons**: Direct raycasting for instant-hit weapons (lasers, pulse)

neutral: '#ffff44'   // Yellow for neutral  
friendly: '#44ff44'  // Green for friendly
unknown: '#44ffff'   // Cyan for unknown
```

### **🚨 CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT PRACTICE: No Defensive Programming**

**WE DO NOT USE DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING DURING DEVELOPMENT**

**Philosophy**: Crashes reveal bugs faster than fallback layers can hide them. In development mode:
- ✅ **Allow crashes** - They expose bugs immediately
- ✅ **Fail fast** - Don't hide errors with try/catch blocks
- ✅ **No fallback layers** - Let system failures be visible
- ✅ **Immediate debugging** - Crash reports show exact failure points

**When crashes occur:**
- **Root cause analysis** - Fix the underlying issue, don't add fallbacks
- **System design flaws** - Revealed through failure patterns
- **Integration problems** - Exposed immediately rather than masked

**Production will have defensive layers**, but development prioritizes bug visibility over system stability.

## 🔒 Discovery System Security Fixes ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Status**: ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION** - Undiscovered objects now properly hide all sensitive information

### **🚨 Critical Security Issues Resolved**

#### **1. Information Leakage Prevention** ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: Undiscovered objects were revealing sensitive information before discovery
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive information security across all systems

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ **Hull Indicators**: Station hull percentages only show for discovered objects
- ✅ **Service Icons**: Mission boards, repair services, etc. hidden until discovery
- ✅ **Type Information**: Object types show as "Unknown" until discovered
- ✅ **Faction Colors**: All undiscovered objects show cyan "Unknown" color
- ✅ **Subsystem Information**: Ship subsystems bypass discovery (ships always show), stations require discovery

#### **2. Ship vs Station Logic** ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: Ships and stations had inconsistent discovery requirements
**Solution**: Proper separation of ship and station discovery logic

**Logic Implementation**:
- ✅ **Ships**: Always show full information (no discovery required)
- ✅ **Target Dummies**: Always show subsystems (treated as ships)
- ✅ **Stations**: Require discovery for detailed information
- ✅ **Celestial Bodies**: Require discovery for detailed information

#### **3. Position Validation** ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: Objects with Star Charts entries but no 3D positions caused color inconsistencies
**Solution**: Added position validation to discovery logic

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Objects must have BOTH discovery status AND valid 3D position
const hasValidPosition = this.getTargetPosition(currentTargetData) !== null;
const isObjectDiscovered = currentTargetData?.isShip || 
    (this.isObjectDiscovered(currentTargetData) && hasValidPosition);
```

#### **4. Station Type Recognition** ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: Only "station" types were recognized, missing "Mining Complex", "Research Station", etc.
**Solution**: Expanded station type detection

**Station Types Now Recognized**:
- ✅ **"station"** - Generic stations
- ✅ **"Mining Station"** - Phobos Mining Station
- ✅ **"Mining Complex"** - Vesta Mining Complex  
- ✅ **"Research Station"** - Europa Research Station
- ✅ **"Defense Platform"** - Callisto Defense Platform
- ✅ **"*facility"** - Any facility type
- ✅ **"*base"** - Any base type

#### **5. Critical Error Fixes** ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: JavaScript errors from undefined position calculations
**Solution**: Added null checks to prevent crashes

**Error Prevention**:
- ✅ **StarfieldManager**: Added null checks to `calculateDistance()`
- ✅ **Position Extraction**: Proper error handling for missing 3D objects
- ✅ **Distance Calculations**: Graceful handling of invalid positions

### **🔧 Technical Implementation Details**

#### **Files Modified**:
- **`TargetComputerManager.js`**: Primary discovery logic and security implementation
- **`StarfieldManager.js`**: Position calculation error prevention
- **Data files**: Station type definitions and recognition

#### **Key Methods Enhanced**:
- **`updateStatusIcons()`**: Added discovery check for service icons
- **`updateTargetDisplay()`**: Added type and color security for undiscovered objects
- **`constructStarChartsId()`**: Consolidated ID construction with proper station type handling
- **`isObjectDiscovered()`**: Enhanced with position validation
- **`calculateDistance()`**: Added null checks to prevent crashes

#### **Security Logic Flow**:
1. **Check if object is ship** → If yes, show all information
2. **Check Star Charts discovery status** → Must be discovered
3. **Check valid 3D position** → Must have renderable position
4. **Apply information based on discovery** → Show real info or "Unknown"

### **🎯 Result: Complete Information Security**

**Before Fixes**:
- ❌ Undiscovered stations showed hull percentages
- ❌ Service icons visible before discovery
- ❌ Real object types leaked ("Defense Platform", etc.)
- ❌ Faction colors shown before discovery
- ❌ JavaScript errors from position calculations

**After Fixes**:
- ✅ **Undiscovered objects**: Show as "Unknown" / "Unknown" with cyan color
- ✅ **No service icons**: Mission boards, repair services hidden until discovery
- ✅ **No hull information**: Station health hidden until discovery
- ✅ **Ships unaffected**: Target dummies and ships always show full information
- ✅ **Error-free**: No position calculation crashes
- ✅ **Consistent behavior**: All station types properly recognized and secured

### **🧪 Testing Validation**

**Test Cases Verified**:
- ✅ **Callisto Defense Platform**: Shows "Unknown"/"Unknown"/cyan when undiscovered
- ✅ **Mars Base**: No hull percentage or service icons when undiscovered
- ✅ **Mining Stations**: Properly recognized as stations, security applied
- ✅ **Target Dummies**: Always show subsystems (ship behavior)
- ✅ **Position Errors**: No more JavaScript crashes from invalid positions

**Discovery Flow Verified**:
1. **Approach undiscovered object** → Shows as "Unknown" with cyan wireframe
2. **Enter discovery range (100km)** → Discovery notification appears
3. **Object becomes discovered** → Real name, type, faction color, services appear
4. **Information persists** → Discovered objects maintain their revealed information

This comprehensive security implementation ensures that the discovery system maintains proper information security while providing a smooth gameplay experience where players must explore to learn about the universe around them.

## 🎯 Target Loss & Position Validation Fixes ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Status**: ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE TARGET SYSTEM FIXES** - Resolved race conditions and position lookup issues

### **🚨 Critical Issues Resolved**

#### **1. Target Loss Race Condition** ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: Objects showed discovered colors (green/yellow) in HUD frame but "Unknown" wireframes (cyan), then lost target completely
**Root Cause**: Race condition in `updateTargetDisplay()` flow where HUD colors were set before position validation

**Solution**: Reordered target display logic to check position validity FIRST:
```javascript
// OLD FLOW: Get data → Set colors → Check position → Clear if invalid
// NEW FLOW: Check position FIRST → Clear immediately if invalid → Then process data
const targetPos = this.getTargetPosition(this.currentTarget);
if (!targetPos) {
    console.warn('🎯 Cannot calculate distance for range check - invalid target position');
    this.clearCurrentTarget(); // Clear immediately to prevent inconsistent state
    return;
}
```

#### **2. Star Charts Object Preservation** ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: Valid Star Charts objects were being cleared when they temporarily lost 3D positions
**Solution**: Enhanced `getCurrentTargetData()` to preserve Star Charts objects even without 3D positions:
```javascript
// Preserve Star Charts objects that may have lost their 3D position
if (this.currentTarget && this.currentTarget.name) {
    const hasStarChartsId = this.currentTarget.id && this.currentTarget.id.toString().startsWith('A0_');
    const isDiscoveredObject = this.isObjectDiscovered(this.currentTarget);
    
    if (hasStarChartsId || isDiscoveredObject) {
        debug('TARGETING', `🎯 Preserving Star Charts object without 3D position: ${this.currentTarget.name}`);
        return this.processTargetData(this.currentTarget);
    }
}
```

#### **3. Celestial Body Position Resolution** ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: Terra Prime, Luna, and other celestial bodies couldn't be found due to ID/key mismatch
- **Star Charts IDs**: `A0_terra_prime`, `A0_luna`
- **SolarSystemManager keys**: `planet_0`, `moon_0_0`

**Solution**: Added name-based lookup fallback in `getTargetPosition()`:
```javascript
// If still not found, try to find by name in celestial bodies
if (!resolved && name) {
    for (const [key, body] of ssm.celestialBodies) {
        if (body && (body.name === name || body.userData?.name === name)) {
            resolved = body;
            debug('TARGETING', `🎯 Found celestial body by name lookup: ${name} -> ${key}`);
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

#### **4. Readonly Property Error Prevention** ✅ **FIXED**
**Problem**: `TypeError: Attempted to assign to readonly property` errors spamming console
**Root Cause**: `processTargetData()` trying to modify readonly properties on Star Charts objects

**Solution**: Wrapped all property assignments in try-catch blocks:
```javascript
// Beacon property assignments
try {
    targetData.discovered = false;
    targetData.diplomacy = 'unknown';
    targetData.faction = 'Unknown';
} catch (e) {
    // Ignore readonly property errors
    if (e.message && !e.message.includes('readonly')) {
        console.warn('🎯 Error setting beacon properties:', e);
    }
}
```

### **🔧 Technical Implementation Details**

#### **Files Modified**:
- **`TargetComputerManager.js`**: Primary target management and display logic
- **`StarfieldManager.js`**: Position calculation error prevention

#### **Key Methods Enhanced**:
- **`updateTargetDisplay()`**: Reordered to check position validity first
- **`getCurrentTargetData()`**: Added Star Charts object preservation logic
- **`getTargetPosition()`**: Added name-based celestial body lookup
- **`processTargetData()`**: Added readonly property error handling

#### **Position Validation Logic**:
1. **Check target position FIRST** → Must have valid 3D coordinates
2. **Clear target immediately if invalid** → Prevents inconsistent display states
3. **Preserve Star Charts objects** → Keep discovered objects even without 3D positions
4. **Name-based fallback lookup** → Find celestial bodies by name when ID lookup fails

### **🎯 Result: Robust Target Management**

**Before Fixes**:
- ❌ Target loss with green frame + cyan wireframe inconsistency
- ❌ Terra Prime, Luna showing "Unknown" despite being discovered
- ❌ JavaScript error spam from readonly property assignments
- ❌ Race conditions causing display inconsistencies

**After Fixes**:
- ✅ **Consistent Display**: Objects without valid positions show "Unknown" in both frame AND wireframe
- ✅ **No Target Loss**: Star Charts objects preserved even when temporarily losing 3D positions
- ✅ **Position Resolution**: Celestial bodies found by name when ID lookup fails
- ✅ **Error-Free Operation**: No more readonly property error spam
- ✅ **Robust Validation**: Position checks prevent race conditions

### **🧪 Testing Validation**

**Test Cases Verified**:
- ✅ **All 27 objects discovered successfully** without target loss issues
- ✅ **Terra Prime & Luna**: Properly resolved by name-based lookup
- ✅ **Sol**: No more "Unknown" frame after discovery
- ✅ **Consistent Colors**: HUD frame and wireframe colors always match
- ✅ **Error-Free Console**: No more TypeError spam

**Discovery Flow Verified**:
1. **Target object** → Position validated before any display updates
2. **Valid position** → Normal discovery and display logic proceeds
3. **Invalid position** → Target cleared immediately, no inconsistent state
4. **Star Charts objects** → Preserved even without 3D positions
5. **Celestial bodies** → Found by name when ID lookup fails

This comprehensive fix ensures that the targeting system is robust, consistent, and error-free while maintaining all discovery system functionality.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### **Long Range Scanner (LRS) Target Selection** ✅ **FIXED**
**Issue**: After selecting a target from the Long Range Scanner for the first time, subsequent attempts to select different targets from the LRS may fail to properly update the target computer.

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Implemented robust target selection synchronization
- **Solution**: Refactored target selection logic with `setScannerTargetRobustly()` method
- **Key Improvements**:
  - Forced fresh target list updates before each selection
  - Proper state preservation and restoration
  - Enhanced error handling and recovery
  - Consistent synchronization between all target management systems

**Technical Details**:
- **Root Cause**: Race conditions between target list rebuilding and stale index references
- **Fix**: New `setScannerTargetRobustly()` method that:
  - Always forces fresh target list updates
  - Handles out-of-range targets properly
  - Ensures proper synchronization between LRS, TargetComputerManager, and StarfieldManager
  - Includes error recovery and state restoration
  - Uses immediate + delayed UI updates for reliability

**Related Systems**:
- `LongRangeScanner.js` - Updated with robust target selection method
- `TargetComputerManager.js` - Existing `setTargetFromScanner()` method preserved
- `StarfieldManager.js` - Enhanced synchronization handling

### **Star Charts Wireframe Update Bug** ✅ **FIXED**
**Issue**: When selecting targets from Star Charts, the wireframe in the Target Computer HUD would not update - it would stay showing whatever wireframe was visible when the Star Charts were opened.

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Fixed wireframe update synchronization between Star Charts and Target Computer

**Root Cause**: The `setTargetById()` method (used when clicking Star Charts targets) was missing the wireframe cleanup and recreation logic that `cycleTarget()` (TAB cycling) had.

**Solution**: Added proper wireframe update logic to `setTargetById()`:
- Clear existing wireframe before creating new one
- Call `createTargetWireframe()` to generate wireframe for new target
- Maintain same cleanup pattern as TAB cycling

**Technical Details**:
- **File**: `frontend/static/js/views/TargetComputerManager.js`
- **Method**: `setTargetById()` - added wireframe cleanup and recreation logic
- **Behavior**: Now matches TAB cycling behavior for consistent wireframe updates
- **Impact**: Star Charts selections now properly update wireframes (icosahedron for planets, star for stars, octahedron for moons/stations, etc.)

**Testing**: Verified that clicking different objects in Star Charts now shows correct wireframe types:
- Planets: Icosahedron (20-sided sphere)
- Stars: Star (radiating points)
- Moons: Octahedron (8-sided)
- Stations: Torus (ring shape)

### **Navigation Beacon Positioning Bug** ✅ **FIXED**
**Issue**: Only 2 of 8 navigation beacons were visible in Star Charts despite test mode being enabled and all beacons being discovered.

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Fixed beacon angle calculation in Star Charts display

**Root Cause**: The `getLiveAngleDegByName()` method was using `Math.atan2(pos.z, pos.x)` for all celestial bodies, but navigation beacons require `Math.atan2(pos.y, pos.x)` because they use `[x, y, z]` coordinates where `y` is the vertical coordinate, not `z`.

**Solution**: Updated `getLiveAngleDegByName()` method in StarChartsUI.js:
- Added beacon detection logic using `name.includes('Navigation Beacon')`
- For beacons: use `Math.atan2(pos.y, pos.x)` (correct coordinate)
- For other objects: use `Math.atan2(pos.z, pos.x)` (existing logic)
- Added debug logging to track coordinate selection

**Technical Details**:
- **File**: `frontend/static/js/views/StarChartsUI.js`
- **Method**: `getLiveAngleDegByName()` - added beacon-specific angle calculation
- **Coordinate Usage**:
  - **Beacons**: `[x, y, z]` → angle uses `(y, x)` for proper 2D positioning
  - **Other objects**: `[x, y, z]` → angle uses `(z, x)` for top-down display
- **Impact**: All 8 navigation beacons now display at correct positions around the beacon ring:
  - East: (175, 0), North: (0, 175), West: (-175, 0), South: (0, -175)
  - NE: (124, 124), NW: (-124, 124), SW: (-124, -124), SE: (124, -124)

**Before Fix**: Multiple beacons calculated to same angles (0° or 180°) causing overlaps
**After Fix**: Each beacon gets unique angle for proper ring distribution

---

### **Star Chart Hit Box Improvements** ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Issue**: Small objects on the star chart were difficult to click when zoomed way out, requiring pixel-perfect accuracy.

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Added larger invisible hit boxes for improved clickability

**Root Cause**: Visual elements were small but clickable areas matched their visual size exactly, making it frustrating to click objects when zoomed out.

**Solution**: Implemented larger invisible hit boxes that are 2-3x larger than visual elements:
- Added `getObjectHitBoxRadius()` method to calculate larger hit box sizes
- Created invisible SVG elements positioned behind visual elements
- Hit boxes scale with zoom level for consistent clickability
- Added proper CSS styling with `starchart-hitbox` class

**Technical Details**:
- **Files Modified**:
  - `frontend/static/js/views/StarChartsUI.js` - Added hit box rendering logic
  - `frontend/static/css/views.css` - Added `.starchart-hitbox` styling
- **Hit Box Sizes** (2x visual size minimum):
  - **Stars**: 20px minimum radius (2x visual)
  - **Planets**: 12px minimum radius (2x visual)
  - **Moons**: 10px minimum radius (2x visual)
  - **Space Stations**: 8px minimum radius (2x visual)
  - **Navigation Beacons**: 6px minimum radius (2x visual)
- **Implementation Features**:
  - Invisible but clickable (transparent fill/stroke)
  - Proper layering (hit boxes behind visual elements)
  - Zoom-level scaling for consistent UX
  - Different shapes for different object types

**Impact**: Dramatically improves user experience when navigating star charts, especially when zoomed out. Users can now easily click on small objects without requiring pixel-perfect accuracy.

**Testing**: Verified that hit boxes work at all zoom levels and don't interfere with visual appearance.

## 🔧 Debug System - Essential for New Team Members

### **🚨 IMPORTANT: Use `debug()` instead of `console.log()`**

This project uses a **smart debug logging system** instead of `console.log()`. All debug output goes through the `debug(channel, message)` function which provides:

- ✅ **Channel-based filtering** - Toggle specific debug categories on/off
- ✅ **Icon-coded messages** - Visual categorization of log types
- ✅ **Performance optimization** - Disabled channels don't generate output
- ✅ **Runtime control** - Enable/disable channels via browser console
- ✅ **Persistent settings** - Channel states saved in localStorage + file-based config

### **Dynamic Debug Channels Overview**

**📊 This section is auto-generated from `/frontend/static/js/debug-config.json`**

| Channel | Icon | Description | Default State |
|---------|------|-------------|---------------|

```

#### **🔴 P1 (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**When to enable:** Debugging high-priority issues, system state tracking, workflow debugging (default: disabled)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Reserve P1 for:**
- **Critical system failures**
- **Data corruption**
- **Security issues**
- **Game-breaking errors**

**DO NOT use P1 for:**
- Status messages (use appropriate channel like `STATUS`)
- Connection tests (use `MISSIONS` channel)
- Normal operation logging (use specific channel)

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - P1 for critical issues
debug('P1', 'CRITICAL: System initialization failed');
debug('P1', 'SECURITY: Invalid authentication detected');
debug('P1', 'DATA: Corruption detected in save file');

// ❌ WRONG - P1 misused for status messages
debug('P1', 'MissionAPIService: Connection test PASSED'); // Use MISSIONS channel
debug('P1', 'System ready for operation'); // Use UTILITY or STATUS channel

// Examples of when to use P1:
debug('P1', 'System initialization sequence started');
debug('P1', 'Database connection pool size: 10');
debug('P1', 'Security module loaded successfully');
debug('P1', 'Critical workflow step completed');
```

#### **⚠️ IMPORTANT: P1 vs Console Errors**
**For critical errors that must always be visible, use console.error/console.warn instead:**
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Error might be filtered out if P1 is disabled
debug('P1', 'CRITICAL ERROR: System initialization failed');

// ✅ CORRECT - Error always visible regardless of debug settings
console.error('CRITICAL ERROR: System initialization failed');
console.warn('SECURITY WARNING: Invalid authentication attempt');

// P1 is for debugging information, not for critical errors
debug('P1', 'Debug: Initialization sequence reached step 5');
```

### **🚀 Debug Workflow Best Practices**

#### **1. Start with Clean Console (Default State)**
```javascript
// Fresh session - console errors/warnings always visible
// Debug messages filtered out for clean output
// P1 disabled by default, only enable when debugging
```

#### **2. Enable Specific Channels for Focused Debugging**
```javascript
// Debugging targeting system issues
debugEnable('TARGETING');
debugEnable('COMBAT'); // If combat is involved

// Debugging navigation problems
debugEnable('NAVIGATION');
debugEnable('STAR_CHARTS'); // If charts are involved
```

#### **3. Use Multiple Channels for Complex Issues**
```javascript
// Debugging a complex mission system issue
debugEnable('MISSIONS', 'ECONOMY', 'MONEY', 'INFRASTRUCTURE');
```

#### **4. Disable Channels When Done**
```javascript
// Clean up after debugging
debugDisable('TARGETING', 'COMBAT');
// Or reset everything
debugReset();
```

#### **5. Persistent Configuration**
```javascript
// Save your preferred debug setup to file
debugSaveFile(); // Saves to /static/js/debug-config.json

// Load from file
debugLoadFile(); // Loads from file

// View current file config
debugConfigFile();
```

#### **Migration from console.log():**

When you see `console.log()` in existing code, replace it with `debug()` using the most appropriate channel:

```javascript
// OLD CODE - Avoid this
console.log('Player credits updated:', credits);
console.log('🎯 Target acquired:', target.name);

// NEW CODE - Use this (SmartDebugManager adds icons automatically)
debug('MONEY', 'PlayerCredits: Credits updated to', credits);
debug('TARGETING', 'Target acquired:', target.name);
```

**Output Format:**
```
💵 MONEY: PlayerCredits: Credits updated to 50000
🎯 TARGETING: Target acquired: Enemy Ship
🔴 P1: System initialization sequence started
🔴 P1: Database connection pool established
🔴 P1: Security module verification complete
```

#### **Error Handling Best Practices**
```javascript
// For errors that should ALWAYS be visible:
console.error('DATABASE: Connection failed - retrying...');
console.warn('AUTH: Invalid login attempt detected');

// For debugging information that might be filtered:
debug('P1', 'Database connection retry attempt #3');
debug('P1', 'Auth module validation passed');
```

#### **Debug Configuration File:**

The debug system supports **file-based configuration** for persistent settings between browser sessions:

**Location:** `/frontend/static/js/debug-config.json`  
**URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:5001/static/js/debug-config.json`

**File Structure:**
```json
{
    "channels": {
        "TARGETING": { "enabled": true },
        "P1": { "enabled": false },
        // ... other channels
    },
    "global": {
        "useFileConfig": true,
        "useLocalStorage": true
    }
}
```

**To modify debug settings:**
1. Edit `/frontend/static/js/debug-config.json`
2. Change `"enabled": true/false` for desired channels
3. Reload the browser page
4. Debug settings will be applied automatically

**Browser Console Commands:**
```javascript
debugLoadFile()     // Load from file
debugConfigFile()   // Show current file config
debugSyncFile()     // Sync browser with file
```

### **For New Team Members:**

1. **Always use `debug()` instead of `console.log()`**
2. **Choose the most specific channel available**
3. **Use `P1` channel for critical errors/warnings**
4. **NEVER embed icons in debug message text - SmartDebugManager adds them automatically**
5. **Test your debug statements by toggling channels on/off**
6. **Use descriptive messages that include relevant data**

### Star Charts ↔ Target Computer Integration ✅ **COMPLETED**

**✅ COMPLETED**: Full integration with simplified, robust target management

**Key Improvements**:
- **Unified Wireframes**: Navigation beacons now use octahedron (simple pyramid) geometry for better visual distinction
- **Simplified Targeting**: Removed automatic target clearing - targets persist until manually changed or sector warp
- **Fail-Fast Approach**: Target lookup failures crash immediately for debugging (dev mode)
- **Essential Sync**: Reduced sync frequency to 10s with only critical operations (target availability + wireframe hydration)
- **Discovery Isolation**: New discoveries only show notifications, don't automatically change current target

**Technical Changes**:
- **WireframeTypes.js**: Centralized geometry mapping with octahedron for navigation beacons
- **StarChartsManager.js**: Fail-fast target selection with error assertions
- **TargetComputerManager.js**: Removed range monitoring, persistent targeting
- **StarChartsTargetComputerIntegration.js**: Simplified sync operations, reduced frequency

**Benefits**:
- **Consistent Targeting**: Same wireframes whether selected via TAB or Star Charts
- **Predictable Behavior**: No unexpected target changes during gameplay
- **Better Debugging**: Immediate crashes expose target lookup issues
- **Improved Performance**: Less frequent sync operations
- **User Control**: Players maintain target selection until explicitly changed
