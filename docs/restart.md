## 🚀 LATEST MAJOR UPDATES (Current Session)

### 🎯 **Missile Combat System Debugging** ⭐ CRITICAL FIXES
- **Issue Resolved**: ✅ **Missiles not hitting targets despite collision detection**
  - **Problem**: Collision distance threshold too strict (0.5 units), rejecting valid hits
  - **Solution**: Increased threshold to 5.0 units in `PhysicsManager.js` for reliable collision processing
  - **Result**: Missiles now consistently hit targets with proper collision detection

- **Collision Timing Fix**: ✅ **Missiles hitting too fast for collision delay**
  - **Problem**: 50ms collision delay blocking hits occurring at 17-20ms flight time
  - **Solution**: Reduced collision delay to 15ms in `WeaponCard.js` for optimal timing
  - **Result**: Missiles briefly visible before impact with instant hit registration

- **Projectile Collision Filtering**: ✅ **Missiles passing through each other properly**
  - **Problem**: Field name mismatch (`entityType` vs `type`) preventing projectile filtering
  - **Solution**: Corrected to use `collisionTarget.type === 'projectile'` for filtering
  - **Result**: Missiles ignore collisions with other projectiles as intended

- **Unified UI Feedback System**: ✅ **Consolidated message display**
  - **Enhancement**: Combined `messageDisplay` and `weaponFeedbackDisplay` in `WeaponHUD.js`
  - **Feature**: Priority-based message system with proper hit/miss/damage feedback
  - **Result**: Clean, organized weapon feedback with priority handling

- **Collision Processing Improvements**: ✅ **Enhanced damage application**
  - **Fix**: Improved collision distance detection and contact point processing
  - **Enhancement**: Better trajectory calculation with camera direction simplification
  - **Result**: Consistent damage application with subsystem targeting and destruction feedback

### 🎯 **Previous Combat System Refinements**
- **Crosshair Targeting Fix**: ✅ **Synchronized weapon system and UI targeting calculations**
  - **Issue**: Red circle crosshair not showing for valid shots despite successful targeting
  - **Root Cause**: Range calculation discrepancy between weapon system and UI (missing 30km fallback)
  - **Solution**: Unified weapon range calculation with consistent fallback logic
  - **Result**: UI crosshair now perfectly matches actual weapon targeting accuracy

- **Enhanced Missile Visibility**: ✅ **Missiles now visible during normal combat**
  - **Issue**: Missile projectiles only visible in Ctrl+P debug mode
  - **Solution**: Enhanced `MeshBasicMaterial` with 5m radius for better visibility
  - **Colors**: Bright red (homing missiles) and green (standard missiles) for clear identification
  - **Performance**: Self-illuminated materials for optimal rendering performance

- **Audio System Improvements**: ✅ **Fixed missing weapon impact sounds**
  - **Issue**: `[Warning] HTML5: No audio mapping found for sound type: impact`
  - **Solution**: Updated weapon effects to use proper 'explosion' audio mapping
  - **Enhancement**: Missile explosions only play sound on hits, silent on misses
  - **Result**: Clean audio feedback with proper impact/explosion sound effects

- **UI Positioning Enhancements**: ✅ **Improved weapon feedback layout**
  - **Enhancement**: Moved weapon feedback messages to align with autofire messages
  - **Position**: Consolidated weapon-related HUD elements for better visual hierarchy
  - **Result**: Cleaner, more organized weapon status display

- **Solution**: Enhanced collision radius calculation with speed compensation
- **Improvements**:
  - ✅ **Minimum 8.0m collision radius** (up from 0.5m close combat)
  - ✅ **Close-range boost**: 10.0m minimum for targets <10km
  - ✅ **Speed-compensated CCD**: More aggressive motion threshold (0.1m max)

- **Root Cause**: Physics world state corruption after collisions causing manifolds to disappear
- **Symptoms**: Collision manifolds detected (1 found) but immediately drop to 0 before processing
- **Solution**: Added physics world state cleanup after each collision
- **Technical Fixes**:
