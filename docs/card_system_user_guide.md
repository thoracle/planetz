## üéÆ Overview

The PlanetZ card system is inspired by **Clash Royale's collection mechanics** but applied to spaceship systems. Players collect NFT-style cards that represent ship components, weapons, and systems. Each card can be stacked and upgraded, providing a strategic deck-building element to the space combat gameplay.

### Key Features

- **üÉè NFT-Style Cards**: Each card has unique token IDs and metadata
- **üìö Card Stacking**: Identical cards stack together for upgrades
- **üéØ Strategic Placement**: Universal slot system with tactical choices
- **üîÑ Never Destroyed**: Cards accumulate permanently in your collection
- **üé® Pok√©dex Discovery**: Silhouettes until first discovery
- **‚ö° Real-Time Combat**: Cards provide active ship systems and weapons

## ü§ñ AI System Card Standardization

### Enemy Ship Card Integration

**All AI enemy ships use the same card system as players**. When enemy ships are destroyed, they drop their equipped cards which players can collect and use. This ensures consistency and prevents duplicate systems.

#### AI-Specific Card Mappings

AI ships currently use specialized weapon configurations that need to be mapped to standard player cards:

| AI Weapon Type | Standard Card Equivalent | Rarity | Level Range |
|----------------|-------------------------|--------|-------------|
| **energy_pulse** | Pulse Cannon | Common | 2-3 |
| **energy_cannon** | Laser Cannon | Common | 3-4 |
| **plasma_cannon** | Plasma Cannon | Common | 4-5 |
| **long_range_beam** | Particle Beam | Rare | 4-5 |
| **defensive_turret** | Laser Cannon | Common | 2-3 |
| **dual_turret** | Phaser Array | Rare | 3-4 |

#### Shield System Standardization

The AI system currently uses inconsistent shield naming that needs standardization:

| Current AI Term | Standard Card | Function |
|----------------|---------------|----------|
| **basic_shields** | Shield Generator (Level 1) | Basic energy barrier |
| **shield_generator** | Shield Generator | Creates protective energy barriers |
| **shields** | Shields | Active deflector shield system |

#### Required Card System Updates

**These AI-specific variations need to be removed and replaced with standard leveled cards:**

1. **Remove Level Variants**: 
   - `warp_drive_low` ‚Üí `warp_drive` Level 1
   - `warp_drive_mid` ‚Üí `warp_drive` Level 3
   - `warp_drive_high` ‚Üí `warp_drive` Level 5

2. **Standardize Weapon Types**:
   - `energy_pulse` ‚Üí `pulse_cannon` Level 2-3
   - `energy_cannon` ‚Üí `laser_cannon` Level 3-4
   - `defensive_turret` ‚Üí `laser_cannon` Level 2-3
   - `dual_turret` ‚Üí `phaser_array` Level 3-4

3. **Fix Shield Naming**:
   - `basic_shields` ‚Üí `shield_generator` Level 1
   - Ensure `shield_generator` and `shields` are properly differentiated

4. **Radar Integration**:
   - Confirm `basic_radar` is available as a droppable common card
   - Ensure proper integration with proximity detector systems

### Card Drop Mechanics for AI Ships

When AI enemy ships are destroyed, they should drop cards based on their loadout:

- **Scout Ships**: Drop Level 1-2 common cards (pulse_cannon, impulse_engines, basic_radar)
- **Fighter Ships**: Drop Level 2-3 common/rare cards (laser_cannon, plasma_cannon, shield_generator)  
- **Gunships**: Drop Level 3-4 rare cards (plasma_cannon, phaser_array, tactical_computer)
- **Freighters**: Drop Level 1-3 utility cards (cargo_hold, defensive_turret, subspace_radio)
