The numbers (3, 4, 5) show how excited/satisfied you feel at each milestone. Start by exploring space to find planets and stations, then collect items through missions and trading, combine them to make awesome gear, and finally become powerful enough to influence entire factions!

> **🐣 FYI**: Imagine this like a video game character creation flow! You start as a New Player (blue box), then progress through colored phases that build on each other. Each phase has specific activities (the smaller boxes) that teach you different skills. The colors help you remember: Purple = Learning, Green = Gathering, Orange = Creating, Pink = Mastering. Notice how you can't skip phases - you need to explore before you can collect, collect before you can craft, and craft before you can master the galaxy!

> **🐣 FYI**: This is like a never-ending adventure wheel! You start by exploring (blue boxes), which gives you items to collect (green boxes), which you can combine to create awesome gear (orange boxes), which makes you powerful enough to access new areas (pink boxes). The arrows show the flow, and the loop at the end means you keep going forever! Each color represents a different type of activity - it's like having different "jobs" in the game that you switch between as you get better.

> **🐣 FYI**: Think of this like a giant shopping mall with different stores! The sources (blue boxes at top) are like different stores - missions give you rewards, combat drops you items when you fight, trading gives you money, mining lets you dig up resources. Each source feeds into different types of items (weapon cards, ship parts, etc.) that all end up in your Card Inventory (yellow box). From there, you can use them to customize your ship and create different playstyles. It's showing you all the ways to get cool stuff in the game!

The green bars show activities you've already done (like exploring), the blue bars show what you're currently doing (planet discovery), and the gray bars show future goals. Each phase takes a different amount of time - exploration happens quickly, but mastering the galaxy takes much longer. It's a roadmap so you know what to expect and can plan your playing sessions!

The arrows show how they all help each other - better maps lead to better collection, which leads to better crafting, which leads to more power that lets you discover even more!

> **🐣 FYI**: This is like choosing your character's class in an RPG, but with collection strategies! Start by thinking about what you like doing most - are you aggressive and love fighting? Do you prefer exploring? Trading? Combat? Your choice leads to different paths that give you different types of items. For example, if you choose "Aggressive Collector", you'll focus on combat missions that drop lots of weapons. If you choose "Trading Focus", you'll get items from delivery missions. Each path leads to different cards in your inventory that create unique playstyles!

## 📈 Collection Value Progression

```mermaid
pie title Collection Item Rarity Distribution
    "Common Items" : 65
    "Uncommon Items" : 20
    "Rare Items" : 10
    "Epic Items" : 4
    "Legendary Items" : 1
```

> **🐣 FYI**: This pie chart shows how rare different items are - like finding trading cards! 65% of items are Common (easy to get, like basic weapons), 20% are Uncommon (a bit harder, like better shields), 10% are Rare (challenging, like special ship parts), 4% are Epic (very hard, like advanced tech), and only 1% are Legendary (super rare, like one-of-a-kind treasures). This tells you what to expect - most items you'll find easily, but the really special ones will take a lot of effort to collect!

> **🐣 FYI**: Imagine a magical garden where everything grows together! Your actions (blue boxes on left) like exploring, doing missions, fighting, and trading create items that go into your collection system (green boxes). This makes the world respond (orange boxes) with new missions, changing prices, and better faction relations. You get better equipment and opportunities (pink boxes), which lets you do even more actions. It's a positive cycle - the more you play, the more the game opens up, and the more fun you have!

> **🐣 FYI**: Think of this like the behind-the-scenes of a restaurant! The Frontend (blue) is what you see - the Star Charts UI, discovery manager, collection interface, and synthesis engine. The Backend (purple) is the kitchen - mission engine, item database, trading system, and faction manager. The Data Layer (green) is the pantry - static universe data, dynamic state, player progress, and collection history. The Integration Layer (orange) is the waitstaff connecting everything smoothly. All these parts work together so your collection experience feels seamless!

They get refined and enhanced (green boxes), which increases their value through rarity and market factors (orange boxes). Finally, they contribute to your player economy (pink boxes) through credits, investment opportunities, trading power, and economic influence. It's showing how everything you collect turns into economic power!

> **🐣 FYI**: Think of this like choosing your character's "job" in the game! You can be an Explorer (focusing on discovering new places), a Warrior (focusing on combat and weapons), a Trader (focusing on commerce and markets), or a Collector (focusing on gathering everything). Each archetype leads to different types of items and specialized loadouts. For example, Warriors get lots of weapon cards, Traders get economic tools, Explorers get mapping items, and Collectors get a bit of everything. All paths eventually lead to "Master Collection" and "Ultimate Power" - you just get there through different activities!
