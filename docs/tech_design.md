   - Implements state pattern for operational states

3. **Upgrade System**
   - Manages upgrade installation and removal
   - Tracks power consumption and slot usage

   - Systems can be temporarily disabled or permanently destroyed
   - Systems support both automatic and manual control modes

#### Ship Damage State Diagram
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Operational
    Operational --> Damaged: Take Damage
    Damaged --> Critical: Health < 25%
    Damaged --> Operational: Repair
    Critical --> Disabled: Health = 0%
    Critical --> Damaged: Repair
    Disabled --> Damaged: Repair
    Damaged --> [*]: System Destroyed
```

**Design Notes:**
1. **State Transitions**
   - Damage thresholds trigger state changes (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
   - Each state has unique visual and audio feedback
   - State changes can trigger cascading effects on other systems
   - Repair effectiveness varies by state
   - Critical state has chance of system failure

2. **Operational State**
   - System functioning at 100% effectiveness
   - Normal power consumption
   - No performance penalties
   - Can take damage from various sources
   - Supports all normal operations

3. **Damaged State**
   - Effectiveness reduced proportionally to damage
   - Increased power consumption
   - Visual and audio warnings
   - Can be repaired with kits or at station
   - May affect related systems

4. **Critical State**
   - Severe performance penalties
   - High power consumption
   - Constant warning indicators
   - Risk of cascading failures
   - Limited repair options

5. **Disabled State**
