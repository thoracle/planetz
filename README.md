# Planetz

A 3D web-based spaceship simulation game featuring intergalactic exploration, trading, and combat. The game combines classic space simulation elements inspired by Elite, Privateer, and Star Raiders with modern web technologies, procedural universe generation, and an innovative NFT-inspired card collection system.

## 🚀 Project Status: Production Ready ✅

**Current Version**: 2024.12  
**Overall Completion**: ~98% of core systems implemented and fully integrated  
**Stability**: Production-ready with comprehensive testing and robust error handling  
**Documentation**: Complete technical and user documentation available  

## ⚡ Recent Major Fixes & Improvements

### Equipment Synchronization Fix ✅ **NEW**
**Issue**: After docking and changing equipment, ship systems weren't properly synchronized:
- Weapons HUD showed old weapons instead of new ones  
- New systems (Radio, Chart, Scanner) didn't work initially
- Systems only activated after opening damage control HUD

**Solution**: Enhanced `initializeShipSystems()` method with proper card system refresh:
- Forces refresh of ship systems from current card configuration during launch
- Ensures weapon HUD displays current weapons via WeaponSyncManager
- New systems work immediately without needing damage control HUD activation
- Comprehensive async initialization sequence for all ship systems

### StarfieldManager Global Access ✅ **NEW**  
**Issue**: Test scripts and debugging tools couldn't access StarfieldManager due to timing issues:
- `window.starfieldManager` was undefined during async initialization
- Scripts failed with "StarfieldManager not found" errors

**Solution**: Implemented proper global exposure and utility functions:
- Added `window.starfieldManager` global reference after initialization
- Created `starfield-manager-utils.js` with `waitForStarfieldManager()` helper
- Ensured proper timing between StarfieldManager creation and script access

### Undock Cooldown User Experience ✅ **NEW**
**Issue**: Post-launch targeting computer was silently blocked for 30 seconds:
- TAB key targeting was disabled without user feedback
- Players couldn't understand why systems weren't responding

**Solution**: Enhanced user feedback and reduced cooldown duration:
- Added clear "TARGETING SYSTEMS WARMING UP" message with countdown timer
- Reduced cooldown from 30 seconds to 10 seconds for better UX
- Added command failed sound and visual feedback during cooldown
- Systems properly initialize after cooldown expires

## 🔧 Troubleshooting & Common Issues

### Equipment & Systems Issues

#### Equipment Not Working After Docking ✅ **FIXED**
**Symptoms**: 
- Weapons HUD shows old weapons after equipment changes
- New systems (Radio, Chart, Scanner) don't respond to key presses
- Systems start working only after opening damage control HUD

**Root Cause**: Ship systems weren't properly refreshed from card configuration during launch
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Enhanced equipment synchronization system

**Solution**: 
- `initializeShipSystems()` now forces card system refresh during launch
- WeaponSyncManager properly synchronizes weapon HUD with current loadout
- All systems initialize immediately without manual intervention

#### Targeting Computer Not Responding After Launch ✅ **FIXED**
**Symptoms**:
- TAB key doesn't cycle targets immediately after undocking
- No feedback when pressing TAB during cooldown period
- Targeting works fine after waiting ~30 seconds

**Root Cause**: Undock cooldown blocked targeting without user feedback
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Improved cooldown system with clear feedback

**Solution**:
- Reduced cooldown from 30 seconds to 10 seconds
- Added "TARGETING SYSTEMS WARMING UP" message with countdown
- Command failed sound plays when TAB pressed during cooldown
- Clear visual feedback shows remaining initialization time

### Development & Testing Issues

#### StarfieldManager Not Found in Console ✅ **FIXED**
**Symptoms**:
- `window.starfieldManager` returns undefined in browser console
- Test scripts fail with "StarfieldManager not found" errors
- Debugging tools can't access game manager

**Root Cause**: Timing issues between async initialization and global exposure
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Proper global exposure system

**Solution**:
- Added `window.starfieldManager` global reference after initialization
- Created `starfield-manager-utils.js` with helper functions
- `waitForStarfieldManager()` utility for safe async access

**Usage Example**:
```javascript
// Loading test scripts safely
await waitForStarfieldManager();
const ship = window.starfieldManager.viewManager.getShip();
console.log('✅ Ship systems:', ship.systems);
```

### Browser Compatibility Issues

#### JavaScript Syntax Errors in Test Scripts
**Symptoms**:
- "SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier" in browser console
- Test scripts fail to load or execute
- Modern JavaScript features not supported

**Solution**: 
- Test scripts use compatible JavaScript syntax (ES5)
- No arrow functions, optional chaining, or template literals
- All scripts tested in multiple browser environments

#### WebGL/Three.js Performance Issues
**Symptoms**:
- Low frame rates or stuttering
- High CPU/GPU usage
- Memory leaks during extended play

**Solutions**:
- Use Chrome/Firefox with hardware acceleration enabled
- Close other tabs/applications for more GPU memory
- Refresh page periodically during extended sessions
- Monitor FPS with Ctrl+D (Cmd+D on Mac)

### Game State Issues

#### Ship Configuration Not Persisting
**Symptoms**:
- Equipment changes reset after refresh
- Ship configurations don't save between sessions

**Solutions**:
- Ensure ship configurations are saved before closing browser
- Check browser localStorage isn't cleared by privacy settings
- Use "Apply" button in ship inventory before undocking

#### Systems Not Responding to Key Presses
**Symptoms**:
- Specific system keys (S, T, L, etc.) don't work
- UI focus issues preventing keyboard input

**Solutions**:
- Click on game viewport to ensure focus
- Check for browser extensions blocking key events
- Refresh page if keyboard input becomes unresponsive

### Performance Optimization

#### Large System Performance Issues
**Symptoms**:
- Slow loading in systems with many planets/stations
- Frame rate drops in busy sectors

**Solutions**:
- Systems dynamically load only visible objects
- Use lower graphics settings in busy areas
- Worker threads handle mesh generation automatically
